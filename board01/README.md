==============
If you're interested in modifying or extending the OpenFeeder software or hardware, we strongly
suggest discussing your ideas with the developers *before* starting to work on them.
That way you can coordinate with the OpenFeeder Team and others, giving your work a higher chance
of being integrated into the official release.
